# Connect 4

### Overview
------------------
Two users will play against each other in a game of Connect 4. The objective of the game is to place your chips in a way that you will have four in a row, while also making sure your opponent doesnâ€™t get four in a row. The four consecutive chips can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. The user with the black chips will always go first. The users take turns placing chips until one has four consecutive chips, or until the board is full. Whichever player gets four consecutive chips first wins. If the board is filled before any player achieves that, the game is a tie.
